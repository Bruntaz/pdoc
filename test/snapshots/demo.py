# Test Module

This is a test module demonstrating pdoc's parsing capabilities!

- All docstrings support plain markdown.
- Including code!

  ```python
  print("hello world")
  ```
- You can link to classes or modules: demo.do_foo
  - The only requirement is that you must specify the full qualified path.
  - You can still put it in backticks for a monospace font: `demo.do_foo`
- Module members appear in the order they are listed in the source code.
  If you do not like the order in pdoc, you should probably have a different order in your source file as well.

# More Documentation

You can have multiple section in your module docstring,
which will all show up in the navigation on the left.
